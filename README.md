This is a fully automated Python HiL test environment used for testing IoT-connected devices. This environment targets an ESP32 connected to a cloud dashboard. The ESP32 is used to control an industrial water pump through the commands received from the cloud. The environment utilizes 3rd-party libraries to handle MQTT and Modbus COMs.
